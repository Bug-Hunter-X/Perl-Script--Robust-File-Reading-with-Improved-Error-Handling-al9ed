This repository contains a Perl script that demonstrates a common error in file handling. The script reads a file line by line, but it lacks robustness in handling various error conditions, particularly issues stemming from file encoding or problematic characters.  A solution is provided that enhances error handling to prevent unexpected crashes and improve the script's reliability.
